<h3 align="center">Computer Science Student | Focused on Systems, Web, and Security</h3>

## About Me

* I'm a IT student from Vietnam.
* Currently strengthening fundamentals in:

  * Linux environment
  * Web application architecture
  * Low-level programming (C)
  * How vulnerabilities actually happen in real systems
* Goal: build a solid technical base before moving deeper into offensive security and bug bounty work.

---

## Current Work

* Working on: **Neo League **

  * Implementing features
  * Reading the codebase carefully
  * Understanding data flow, state handling, and real-world structure

---

## What I'm Learning Right Now

* React + TypeScript (to understand modern frontend behavior)
* Backend basics and API design
* Linux internals, networking, CLI workflow
* Debugging and reading unfamiliar code
* Root-cause analysis instead of surface-level fixes

---

## Daily Environment

* OS: Linux
* Editor: Neovim (LazyVim setup)
* Workflow: terminal-first, keyboard-driven

---

## Languages

* C
* JavaScript / TypeScript
* HTML / CSS
* Java

---

## Tools

* Git
* Docker
* Node.js
* Bash / Shell

---

## Learning Approach

* Read documentation, not summaries.
* Reproduce issues locally.
* Trace behavior through code instead of guessing.
* Focus on understanding systems before trying to exploit them.
