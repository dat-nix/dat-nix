## 🧠 About Me

* 🎓 I'm a university student from Vietnam exploring the path from **developer → security engineer**
* 🐧 Daily driving Linux and terminal-based workflows (Neovim, CLI tooling, minimal UI)
* 🔍 Currently diving deep into **web security, system internals, and vulnerability research**
* 🛠 I build applications to understand architecture — then analyze them to understand attack surfaces
* 🎯 Long-term goal: become highly skilled in **offensive security & bug bounty research**

I believe:

> You don't really understand a system until you try to break it.

## 🚧 Current Focus

* 🔭 Working on: **Neo league**
  → Building full-stack features while studying how real-world apps can fail.

* 🌱 Learning (seriously, not just skimming):

  * React + TypeScript (to understand modern frontend attack surface)
  * Backend fundamentals & API design
  * Linux internals & networking
  * Web exploitation methodology (PortSwigger-style learning)
  * Reading codebases to understand real implementations

---

## ⚙️ Technical Environment

**Operating System**

* Linux (daily driver)

**Editor**

* Neovim (LazyVim-based setup tuned for speed & keyboard-centric workflow)

**Languages I Use**

* C (for low-level understanding)
* JavaScript / TypeScript
* HTML / CSS
* Java (academic + code reading)

**Tools I Work With**

* Git
* Docker
* Node.js
* Bash / Shell scripting

## 🔬 What I'm Practicing Now

Instead of chasing certificates, I'm focused on:

* Reading real code, not tutorials
* Understanding root causes of vulnerabilities
* Reproducing bugs in controlled environments
* Writing clean but minimal implementations
* Building intuition about:

  * Trust boundaries
  * Input validation failures
  * State handling
  * Misconfigurations
  * Logic bugs

Most projects are learning-driven and evolve as I deepen understanding.

## 📫 Contact

* Email: **[dtpm4269@gmail.com](mailto:dtpm4269@gmail.com)**

I'm always open to discussions about:

* Linux workflows
* Web architecture
* Security learning paths
* Building a strong technical foundation

## ⚡ Fun Fact

I enjoy staring at terminal screens long enough until bugs reveal themselves.
